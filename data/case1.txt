WHO SOLD JOSEPH?

There was a man named Joseph who had eleven brothers who 
were jealous of him because his father favoured him. 
Their father even bought him a technicolor dream coat, 
which was given to Joseph, but this didn't sit well with his brothers. 
So, they plotted to kill him. One of the brothers suggested that 
he be sold to the Ishmaelites in Dothan. 

Your guest is to find which of his brothers made his decision?
